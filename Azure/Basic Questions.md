# What is Microsoft Azure?
icrosoft Azure is a cloud computing interface that is implemented by Microsoft which developers and IT professionals use to build, deploy and manage cloud applications through a global network of data centres which Microsoft has created for this purpose.

# What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.

# What are the three types of cloud computing?
| Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)  | Platform as a Service(PaaS) | Software as a Service(SaaS) |

| It provides users with components such as OS, networking capabilities, etc. This is a paid service, based on usage and can be used to host applications.  | It enables developers to build and work with applications without having to worry about the infrastructure or management of the hosting environment.  | It involves applications being consumed and used by organizations. Usually, organizations pay for their use of the application |
| Example -  Azure Virtual Machine, Azure VNET  | Example -  Azure SQL, Azure Storage | Example -  Office 365, Salesforce |

# Give examples for instance types of Microsft Azure.
| Instance Typ | Description |
