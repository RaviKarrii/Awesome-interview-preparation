# What is the difference between list, tuples, and sets in Python?
 1. Lists and sets are mutable i.e they can be edited. Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which can’t be edited).
 2. Lists and Tuples are ordered i.e. we can recall the order in which the elements were put in. Sets are unordered i.e. the order of elements is not constant. 
 3. List and tuples can contain duplicate elements. Sets automatically discard any duplicates.
 4. Lists are slower than tuples. Tuples are faster than list. Sets are especially fast at set operations (e.g. union, difference ...) and checking whether an element is contained in a set.
 5. Syntax: list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]. Syntax: tup_1 = (10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20). Syntax: set_1 = {10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20}

# What are the key features of Python?

# What is pep 8?
PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It is a set of rules that specify how to format Python code for maximum readability.

# What sorting algorithm is used in Python's `sort()` and `sorted()` functions?
Python uses [Tim sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort)

# What is the difference between a generator and an iterator
Generator generates a new element each time that is required (e.g. each time the function is called). Iterator has all elements stored in advance.
